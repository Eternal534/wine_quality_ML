## Predicting quality of wine based on chemical attributes
The data that we decided to test our method on is from the UCI machine learning repository. In this data, the response is the quality of Portuguese white and red wine determined by wine connnoisseurs. There are altogether eleven chemical attributes serving as potential predictors. All predictors are continuous while the response is a categorical variable which takes values from 1 to 10.
