## Predicting quality of wine based on chemical attributes
The data that we decided to test our method on is from the UCI machine learning repository. In this data, the response is the quality of Portuguese white and red wine determined by wine connnoisseurs. There are altogether eleven chemical attributes serving as potential predictors. All predictors are continuous while the response is a categorical variable which takes values from 1 to 10. 


The data set contains eleven
explanatory variables that measure wine attributes and one
response variable: ‚Äùwine quality‚Äù. In more detail,

 Fixed acidity: a measurement of the total concentration
of titratable acids and free hydrogen ions present in the
wine. Theoretically, having a low acidity will result in
a flat and boring wine while having too much acid can
lead to tartness or even a sour wine. These acids either
occur naturally in the grapes or are created through the
fermentation process.
 Volatile acidity: a measure of steam distillable acids
present in a wine. In theory, our palates are quite sensitive
to the presence of volatile acids and for that reason a good
wine should keep their concentrations as low as possible.
 Citric acid: one of the many acids that are measured to
obtained fixed acidity.
 Residual sugar: measurement of any natural grape sugars
that are leftover after fermentation ceases. In theory
residual sugar can help wines age well.
 Chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine.
 Free sulfuric dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in
equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas)
and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the
oxidation of wine.
 Total sulfuric dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of
SO2; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable
in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2
becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine.
 Density: measure of density of wine.
 pH: value for pH.
 Sulfates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur
dioxide gas (S02) levels, which acts as an antimicrobial
and antioxidant.
 Alcohol: the percentage of alcohol present in the wine.
 Quality: subjective measurement ranging from 1 to 10
(although the observed data ranges from 3 to 8).
